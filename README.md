summary: "Starting from the raw data, I adapted and translated the original EEGLAB (Matlab) script from ERP CORE into MNE-Python, making all the necessary modifications throughout the preprocessing pipeline to extract the N400."

## Project definition

### Background

As someone without much programming background and no prior experience with EEG experiments, I took on this project to gain hands-on experience working with raw EEG data â€” and to learn how to extract ERP components like the N400, which we often see in published studies.
The goal of the project was to use MNE-Python, the EEG analysis tool introduced in our course module. While the module provides a basic demonstration, it only covers some of the core steps. I wanted to understand the full pipeline, from raw data all the way through preprocessing.

### Tools

MNE-Python
The data preprocessing workflow: https://neuraldatascience.io/7-eeg/introduction.html

### Data

ERP CORE: N400

EEGLAB (Matlab) working pipline

## Results

This is the N400 example produced by ERP CORE:

(Kappenman et al, 2021)

And this is the N400 I generated using the same dataset, after adapting the original MATLAB pipeline to MNE-Python.
