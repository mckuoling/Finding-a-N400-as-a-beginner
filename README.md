# Finding-a-N400-as-a-beginner
This project was developed as my my final project in BrainHack School 2025.

The dataset is sourced from the ERP CORE (N400 Analysis File): https://github.com/mckuoling/ERP_CORE/tree/master/N400%20Analysis%20Files.

The original EEG preprocessing script was written in MATLAB; I adapted and converted it into MNE-Python.

Some of the preprocessing steps were also adapted from: https://neuraldatascience.io/7-eeg/erp_preprocessing.html#
